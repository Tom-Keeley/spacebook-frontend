## Style Guide

For this assignment I used the JS standard style guide:

https://github.com/standard/standard

Here are some of the rules I came across when using this style guide

 - use '' for strings
- If a variable does not get reassigned use const rather than let
- Specific indentation spacing
- Comments need a space between the / and the first character

## NOTES
I unfortunatly ran out of time to perfect the app which i am extremely gutted about as at quite last minuet i had to go to the London office meaning i lost a few days of development time. 

However I have tried to implement pagination and both extension exercises. There is a bug when you add a friend it should automatically re render the friends page, if you refresh it then appears.

Thanks for the Mobile App unit i have genuinely enjoyed learning about React Native as we use it at work!
